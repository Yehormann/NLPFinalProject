Dear Hiring Manager,  
I am excited to apply for the opportunity to contribute to the NLP Project focused on 
building personalized content generation and skill -matching systems. With a strong 
foundation in natural language processing and hands -on experience in AI -driven 
solutions, I am eager to bring my technical expertise and passion for innovation to your 
team.  
In my previous role as an NLP Developer at DataCore, I successfully implemented a 
resume-screening tool that utilized BERT embeddings to match candidate profiles to job 
descriptions with a 90% accuracy rate. This experience closely aligns with your project ’s 
goal of developing a skill -matching system that leverages NLP for identifying gaps and 
providing actionable feedback.  
Additionally, I have experience fine -tuning generative AI models like GPT -4 to produce 
personalized content. For a recent project, I trained a model to generate customized 
email responses, improving user engagement by 35%. I am confident in my ability to 
apply similar techniques to create tailored resumes and cover letters that align with 
your project requirements.  
My technical expertise includes:  
• Proficiency in Python and libraries such as spaCy, NLTK, and Hugging Face 
Transformers.  
• Experience in web development using Flask and building user -friendly interfaces 
for data upload and analysis.  
• A deep understanding of similarity metrics (cosine similarity, BERT embeddings) 
to evaluate document alignment.  
Beyond technical skills, I am a collaborative team player who thrives in dynamic 
environments. I am particularly drawn to your emphasis on user feedback loops to refine generated content, as it reflects an iterative and human -centered approach to AI 
development.  
I am enthusiastic about contributing to this innovative project and am confident my 
skills and experience make me a valuable addition to your team. Thank you for 
considering my application. I would welcome the opportunity to discuss how my 
background align s with your goals and explore how we can achieve project success 
together.  
Sincerely,  
Alex Johnson
